We need to make certain that the submitted data is a `string`. When you read a
value from `formData` (a la `formData.get('field')`), the result could be one of
three things:

1.  `null`: If the value doesn't exist in the form
2.  `string`: If the value is a simple string
3.  `File`: If the value is a file upload

In this case, if the `name` or `username` are anything but `string`, then we've
misconfigured our form (or someone is hitting our action URL directly). In
either case, that's unexpected and we should just throw an error.

We could do this check in an `if` statement:

```tsx
if (typeof sandwichType !== 'string') {
	throw new Error('Expected sandwichType to be a string')
}
```

But there's a handy module for this called `tiny-invariant` that we'll use
instead:

```tsx
import invariant from 'tiny-invariant'

// ...
invariant(
	typeof sandwichType === 'string',
	'Expected sandwichType to be a string',
)
```

So go ahead and add that, we'll test and handle the error itself later.
