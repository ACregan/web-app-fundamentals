# Fields

👨‍💼 We've got a nice `<Field />` component that I want you to use. It has better
styles out of the box and also has a nice error message UI which we'll use later
when we add validation.

Here's a quick example of how to use the `<Field />` component:

```tsx
<Field
	// 💰 you can use the className prop to add styles to the field
	// which we'll do in this exercise, but we don't always need it.
	// className="whatever-you-like"
	labelProps={{ children: 'First Name' }}
	inputProps={{
		name: 'firstName',
		defaultValue: 'Peter',
	}}
	// 💰 you won't use this prop in this exercise, but we'll add it later...
	errors={['This field is required']}
/>
```
