# Forms

👨‍💼 We're ready to start allowing users to change their username and name! Let's
start by adding a form to the profile page. We'll add the `action` later and it
can go on that route, so no need to specify a `action` on the `form`. The
`loader` will load the user's information so you can default the input values to
their current values.
