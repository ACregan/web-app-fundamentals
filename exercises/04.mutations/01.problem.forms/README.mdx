# Forms

👨‍💼 We're ready to start allowing users to change their username and name! Let's
start by adding a form to the profile page. We'll add the `action` later and it
can go on that route, so no need to specify a `action` on the `form`. The
`loader` will load the user's information so you can default the input values to
their current values.

Here's the page: <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile" />

As a reminder, you can login as any user (<LinkToApp to="/admin/users/list" />)
using their username as the password (or you can login as `kody` with
`kodylovesyou` as the password).
