# Actions

👨‍💼 Now it's time to make our form actually _do_ something. So, could you add an
`action` to our route that updates the user's information with what they have
submitted. Don't worry about doing any validation yet. We can trust our users...

Just kidding! 😂 We'll get to that later!

Once the user's data has been updated, go ahead and redirect them to their
profile page.

We know this isn't a Prisma workshop, so 💰 will give you some code to use for
updating the database with the user's submissions.

Also, 🦺 Lily the Life Jacket is going to look the other way on some stuff 😅
We'll fix that later though!

Here's the page: <LinkToApp src="/settings/profile" />

As a reminder, you can login as any user (<LinkToApp src="/admin/users/list" />)
using their username as the password (or you can login as `kody` with
`kodylovesyou` as the password).
