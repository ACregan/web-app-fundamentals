# Error Abstraction

👨‍💼 To keep things consistent, one of our engineers has made a handy abstraction
for error boundaries. You can find it in <InlineFile file="app/components/error-boundary.tsx" />.
Here's how you use it:

```tsx
export function ErrorBoundary() {
	return (
		<GeneralErrorBoundary
			statusHandlers={{
				403: ({ params }) => (
					<p>You're not authorized to look at {params.sandwichId}</p>
				),
			}}
		/>
	)
}
```

Could you please update all our custom ErrorBoundaries to use this abstraction?
Thanks!
