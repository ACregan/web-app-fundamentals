# Form Validation

👨‍💼 Remember when I joked about being able to trust our users and not needing to
do validation? Well... Yeah, that was definitely a joke. Let's add validation.

We're going to focus on just the `name` and `username` to start. I need the
`username` to be `required` and have a minimum character length of 3, and the
`name` needs a minimum length of 1 (yes, some people have a single-character
name).

We're already using the `<Field />` component which accepts an `errors` prop
which it expects to be an array of error messages. That uses another component
we have called `<ErrorList />` which we will use directly for any `formError`s.

Please add some server-side validation to the `action` function and display any
errors returned from that in the form.

Your emoji friends will guide you! Thanks!
