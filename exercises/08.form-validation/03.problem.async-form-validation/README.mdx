# Async Form Validation

🦉 The trick with async validation in Remix is that the entire action function
is already async and you have access to all your data. So this actually isn't
much of an exercise step. What really would be an interesting challenge is doing
client-side validation without requiring a request to the server or submitting
the form. But that's a bit out of scope for this workshop, so you'll have to
come to another workshop to learn that!

👨‍💼 Let's implement the password change functionality. If a new password has been
submitted, we'll need to validate that the current password is provided and
correct before making the change.
