# Disable Default Validation

👨‍💼 Great! Now our user's wont get the built-in browser validation user
experience and instead they'll get our nicer one. But only after our code is
ready to handle that. If the user submits the form before our code has finished
loading, then they'll still get the browser's default validation which is handy.
This is what we call progressive enhancement 😎
