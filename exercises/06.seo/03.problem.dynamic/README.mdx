👨‍💼 For our user pages, we want our users to be excited to share their profile on
social media and have their profiles show up nicely in search results. So their
name should appear in the title and description. The number of ships they have
available or the number of trips they've taken should show up in the
description. You know. Stuff like that. Let's make the username pages awesome.
