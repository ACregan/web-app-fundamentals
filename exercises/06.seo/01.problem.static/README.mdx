# Static meta export

👨‍💼 Have you gotten a look at the browser tab for our app? It looks like
nonsense! Let's at least add a nice title. Also, we should probably set a couple
other configuration bits of metadata as well.

💰 Note, we're not going to use the Remix `<Meta />` component yet. We're just
rendering things directly in the `<head>` for now.

  <div id="files">
    <ul>
      <li data-state="modified">
        <span>modified</span>

        <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />
      </li>
    </ul>

  </div>
