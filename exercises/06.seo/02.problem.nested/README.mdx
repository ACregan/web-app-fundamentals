# Meta Overrides

👨‍💼 We want to be able to override the `title` and `description` for certain
pages. Specifically, we want <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile" /> to have the
title "Edit Profile | Rocket Rental" and the description should be
"Edit your personal Rocket Rental profile". To do this, we'll need to use
Remix's conventional `meta` export for nested routes in combination with its
`<Meta />` component.
