# Handle Errors with Meta

Go to <LinkToApp to="/users/i-do-not-exist" />... Yikes! it's busted! It turns
out that when there's an error in the `loader`, the `meta` export can't use that
data because it never showed up.

ðŸ¦º This is a
[bug in the types in Remix](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/issues/5786)
because it should definitely warn you...

So, let's exercise a bit of defensive programming and make sure that we're
handling the error case. We can just default things to more generic values.
