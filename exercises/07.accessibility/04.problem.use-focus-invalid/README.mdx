# useFocusInvalid

👨‍💼 Well, wouldn't you know, we've already got a hook called `useFocusInvalid`
which does exactly what your `useEffect` did that you wrote in the last step!
Let's use that hook instead.

<TouchedFiles>
  <div id="files">
    <ul>
      <li data-state="modified">
        <span>modified</span>

        <InlineFile file="app/routes/settings+/profile.tsx" />
      </li>
    </ul>

  </div>
</TouchedFiles>
