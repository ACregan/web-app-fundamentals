# Scroll Restoration

üë®‚Äçüíº Now that we've got JavaScript running on the page, our customers are noticing
that their scroll position is not where they expect it to be. For example, if
you're on your profile page and you scroll down (on a short screen) before
clicking the "edit" link, it will not scroll to the top of the page when you
arrive on the profile edit page. This is because the browser is no longer
responsible for navigations, so the role of scroll restoration lies in our
hands!

Luckily, Remix has a
[üìú `ScrollRestoration`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/scroll-restoration)
component we can use to fix this. Please use that component!

Once you've done that, come back here, I've got another task for you.

You got it done? Ok, great! Now I actually need you to "undo" the scroll
restoration for a particular navigation. For a user who is both a host and a
renter, we show a "switch" button to allow you to switch between their host and
renter profiles. To test this out, remember, we have a

<LinkToApp to="/admin/users/list" /> page when you can see the users in the app and
find a user that's both a host and a renter so you can try out what I'm talking about.

When clicking on that switch, it feels awkward to scroll to the top of the page.
Luckily, Remix allows you to control this scroll restoration behavior on a
per-link basis using the
[üìú `preventScrollReset`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link#preventscrollreset)
prop (through React Router):

```tsx
<Link preventScrollReset to="host">
	Host
</Link>
```

Go ahead and add the `preventScrollReset` prop to both of those links.
