# Pending UI

üë®‚Äçüíº Some of our users have complained that the UI doesn't feel responsive because
after they submit their profile form, it can take a while before there are any
updates and they're not sure whether they did something wrong.

This is one of the things the browser did for us before we brought JavaScript
along for the party. Once we brought JavaScript along, we started doing
`event.preventDefault()` which removed the full-page refresh, but also removed
the pending UI feedback the browser shows for us. We need to add that back.

Could you give them some feedback while they're waiting for the server to
respond? Our `<Button>` component has a `status="pending"` prop you can use for
this. We'll also want to disable the button when the form is submitting.

Remix allows you to give the user an even better experience by showing "pending
UI" using
[the `useNavigation` hook](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-navigation).
Only one transition can be happening at a time in the web (you can't go to two
places at once) so that's true here as well. This means you'll need to use the
information from the navigation to determine if the form is submitting or not.

Here's an over-the-top example of `useNavigation` that should help you get a
sense of the information you can get from the `navigation` object (as well as
[the `useFormAction` hook](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-form-action)).

```tsx filename=app/routes/sandwiches.chooser.tsx
export default function SandwichChooser() {
	const navigation = useNavigation()
	const formAction = useFormAction()
	const isSubmitting = navigation.state === 'submitting'
	const isRevalidating = navigation.state === 'loading'
	const isFormAction = navigation.formAction === formAction
	const isFormMethod = navigation.formMethod === 'post'
	const submittedSandwichType = navigation.formData?.get('sandwichType')
	const isRedirecting =
		isRevalidating && navigation.formAction !== navigation.location.pathname
	return (
		<Form method="post">
			<label>
				Type: <input name="sandwichType" />
			</label>
			<button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
				{isRedirecting
					? `All done... redirecting...`
					: isSubmitting
					? `Creating ${submittedSandwichType} Sandwich`
					: `Create Sandwich`}
			</button>
		</Form>
	)
}
```
