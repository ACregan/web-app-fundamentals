# Custom Scripts

👨‍💼 Great! Hopefully you didn't have too much trouble with our use case, but
having that setup will make it much easier for us to explicitly expose public
environment variables to our UI code.

Like it's been said earlier, you don't typically want to have a lot of inline
scripts as they're harder to maintain, but they are sure handy sometimes!
