# Scripts

üë®‚Äçüíº Great work! You should be able to tell now that the page transitions are a
bit smoother and don't trigger full-page reloads. Unfortunately, that also means
the user won't get feedback of their navigations and form submissions if they
take some time. We'll definitely want to come along later and add some pending
UI. But we've got other problems to deal with first.

You may also notice that now when logged in and you click on the user profile
link in the top corner it displays a menu instead of directing you to your
profile page. We actually had been rendering a menu the entire time, but without
JavaScript there were no event handlers to handle that. The reason it linked to
the profile page is because your co-worker who built that put some thought into
Progressive Enhancement and made sure that the link would still work if
JavaScript wasn't loaded. Progressive Enhancement rocks!
