# Scripts

👨‍💼 We had a customer reach out to us this morning. They were surprised when they
noticed they saved their profile information and the page refreshed. They'd
prefer the page not reload when they navigate around our application and submit
their information.

Honestly, I was surprised too! Amazing that the web platform is capable of doing
everything we've done so far without us having to use any client-side
JavaScript. But we've definitely reached a point in our application where we
need to add some JavaScript to make the user experience better. So that's what I
want you to do.

We already have <InlineFile file="app/entry.client.tsx" />, but we're not
loading it because we're not rendering the Remix `<Scripts />` component. Please
do that.
