# Validation aria attributes

üë®‚Äçüíº Remember the first rule of ARIA? Don't use ARIA. If you can use native HTML,
do it. If you can't, then use ARIA.

That's the case for our error messages. So, we need to add `aria-invalid="true"`
and `aria-describedby="error-id"` to the input if there is an error. Otherwise,
those attributes should not appear (so you'll set them to `undefined` in that
case).

<callout-info class="aside">
	Note that there is also `aria-errormessage`, however screen reader support is
	unfortunately very poor for that attribute. We just need to do the best we
	can.
</callout-info>

And we do this for more than just the `input`, we'll want this for the `<form>`
as well.

I suggest you start with <InlineFile file="app/utils/forms.tsx" line="16" /> and
make the `id` on the `ErrorList` component not optional, then TypeScript will
help you know the other places you need to go to add the error ID and handle the
attributes on the form and input elements.
