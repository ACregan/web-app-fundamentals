# Links to Public Files

👨‍💼 Don't look now... But our app looks pretty bad! There are no styles applied
at all! Not even our font is loaded 😬 So, we need you to load that font on
every page in the application so we can have the font everywhere throughout
Rocket Rental.

The file is at <InlineFile file="public/fonts/nunito-sans/font.css" /> and our
server is able to serve it up for you as well. You just need to add the `<link>`
to the document and the font should load up just fine for you.

> 🦉 Remember, check the `Files` section at the bottom of these instructions for
> links that will open your editor to the right file you need to alter. My other
> emoji friends will be waiting there for you to guide you through this task.

🦉 Tip: Check the network tab in the app on the home page. You'll know you got
it right when you see the `font.css` file loaded.
