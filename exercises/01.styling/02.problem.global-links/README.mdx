# Links for Global CSS

👨‍💼 We've got some one-off styles that we want used across the entire site. But,
we don't want to have to put that in our `public` directory. So could you load
the <InlineFile file="app/styles/app.css" /> file in a way to loads it globally,
allows us to cache it forever, but also allows us to make and deploy changes to
that file whenever we need? You'll know you got it right when the testimonials
at the bottom of the homepage have quotes around them
(because <InlineFile file="app/routes/index.tsx" line="876"> the `.quote` class they use </InlineFile> is defined in that stylesheet).

🦉 Tip: check the network tab in the dev tools once you've gotten this one done.
It should show you the file with the "fingerprint" in the URL and you can check
the cache headers as well.
(Those are configured in the <InlineFile file="server/index.ts" line="19" /> file).

🦉 Keep in mind, that when you import a css file in remix and get the stylesheet
URL, it will be a hashed URL. This means that if you change the file, the URL
will change. This is great for caching and happens automatically.
