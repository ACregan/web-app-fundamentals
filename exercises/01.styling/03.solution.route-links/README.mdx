👨‍💼 Thanks for the hard work here. It'll be nice to have that stylesheet
colocated so we can make changes to it and not worry about increasing the

It also means we don't need to worry about the stylesheet's CSS rules applying
to any other page on the site. So feel free to make changes without huge
unexpected consequences.
