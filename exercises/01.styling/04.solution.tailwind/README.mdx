# PostCSS and Tailwind CSS Support

👨‍💼 Phew! Did you feel that? Almost like we just got ourselves a tailwind 🌬️ 😆

Writing CSS with Tailwind feels like we get the power of CSS-in-JS without the
poor performance of runtime implementations because at the end of the day, it's
just stylesheets!

Things look much better now, don't they! But as powerful as tailwind is,
sometimes you just want to style very specific things using some nicely scoped
CSS. So, we're not finished yet...
